# odin-recipes (first project)

This is my first attempt at applying the very limited knowledge I have learned about HTML over the course of the day. 

I will be displaying my ability to perform surface level skills such as creating a web page, creating links, and adding pages. This will be conveyed through a series of food recipes.
